## Design Specification

- **Color Scheme**: Black background (#000000) with white text
- **Accent Colors**: Pink/Mauve (to be added)
- **Design Inspiration**: Troy Kingi's website approach
- **Style**: Simple, striking, full-page photos

## Current Status

✅ Page 1 (Hero/Landing) - HTML & CSS created
- Black background
- Centered logo (placeholder - needs actual logo image)
- Hero image section (placeholder - needs band photo)

## Next Steps

1. **Add Images**:
   - Logo: `rosina-fulllogo-whiteontransparent.png` → save to `/images/`
   - Band photo: `Live 1.jpg` → save to `/images/`

2. **Update HTML** to use real images:
   ```html
   <!-- Replace logo placeholder -->
   <img src="images/rosina-fulllogo-whiteontransparent.png" alt="Rosina & The Weavers">
   
   <!-- Replace hero image placeholder -->
   <img src="images/band-live.jpg" alt="Rosina & The Weavers performing live">
   ```

3. **Build Remaining Pages**:
   - Page 2: About/Bio section
   - Page 3: Videos (Youtube embed carousel)
   - Page 4: Music/Streaming links
   - Page 5: Behind the scenes (Substack/Patreon)
   - Page 6: Merch (Bandcamp links)
   - Page 7: Contact

## How to View

Simply open `index.html` in any web browser:
- Right-click → Open with → Chrome/Firefox/Edge
- Or drag and drop the file into your browser

## Design Notes

- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Clean, semantic HTML5
- Modern CSS with flexbox
- No JavaScript dependencies (for now)
- Placeholder gradients show where images should go

## Collaboration

This project is built collaboratively with A-R (Anna-Rose) providing design direction through Canva mockups.
